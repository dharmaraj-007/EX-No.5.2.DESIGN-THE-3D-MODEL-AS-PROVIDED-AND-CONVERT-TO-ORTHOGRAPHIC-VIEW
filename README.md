# EX No.5.2.DESIGN THE 3D MODEL AS PROVIDED AND CONVERT TO ORTHOGRAPHIC VIEW
## AIM: 
To create orthographic view of given 3D model

## REQUIREMENTS: 
1. Autodesk fusion 360
2. Windows 10
3. 16 GB of RAM (integrated graphics recommend 1 GB or more)
4. 2.5 Mbps or faster download; 500 Kbps or faster upload 

## PROCEDURE:

### STEP-1:
Open Fusion 360 and select file and click new file

### STEP-2:
Select sketch option and choose create sketch

### STEP-3: 
1. Create the sketch using circle, line, trim operations as shown in figure
2. Apply finish sketch 

### STEP-4:
 Use the extrude option to convert the 2D to 3D.

### STEP-5:
Switch to drawing mode from design mode 
          
### STEP-6:
1. Select the base view and position the model to project from base view 
2. Select the projected view to generate orthographic projections
